⚫Car Sale Demand Forecasting using XGBoost Regression
This project aims to accurately **forecast car sale demand** using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques. The core model used is **XGBoost Regressor**, a powerful ensemble algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in regression problems.
Predict the future **demand for car sales** based on historical trends. Accurate demand forecasting helps automotive companies optimize inventory, improve planning, and boost profitability.
Model Used
- **XGBoost Regressor**
  - Handles complex non-linear relationships
  - Robust to missing values

⚫Key Features Engineered

- Date-based features**: Month, Year, Day, Weekday
- Lag features**: Previous day/week sales
- Rolling statistics**: Moving averages, rolling std
- Holiday indicators**: Flag important dates

⚫ Model Evaluation

- Evaluation Metrics:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - R² Score

- Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Used `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators
  - 
 ⚫ Results

- Forecast error reduced significantly using engineered features and hyperparameter tuning.
- Achieved a low RMSE and high R² score (indicating good model fit).
